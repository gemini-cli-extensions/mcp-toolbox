# Gemini CLI Extension - MCP Toolbox

> [!NOTE]
> This extension is currently in beta (pre-v1.0), and may see breaking changes until the first stable release (v1.0).

Develop and query your custom tools using the power of natural language, directly
from your command line through [MCP
Toolbox](https://github.com/googleapis/genai-toolbox). Go from an idea to a
running, invocable tool in minutes, without ever leaving your terminal.

Learn more about [Gemini CLI Extensions](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/extension.md).

## Why Use the MCP Toolbox Extension?

* **Reliable Custom Servers:** Quickly create a **custom MCP server** with tools designed to reliably return accurate results. This saves significant development time and cost by ensuring your agent gets precise data without extensive guidance or fine-tuning.
* **Enterprise Data Awareness:** Instantly upgrade your developer environment by providing your agents with **enterprise-grade data awareness**. Connect your AI systems directly to your data sources for smarter, more relevant operations.
* **Accelerated Agent Development:** Fast-track your AI project by easily testing and validating tool usage with a **pre-built agent environment**.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

*   [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) installed with version **+v0.6.0**.
*   Any required APIs and permissions for connecting to your database.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/gemini-cli-extensions/mcp-toolbox
```

### Configuration

* Add your [`tools.yaml` configuration file](https://googleapis.github.io/genai-toolbox/getting-started/configure/) to the directory you
are running Gemini CLI.

Ensure [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/gcloud) are available in your environment if connecting to Google Cloud services.

### Start Gemini CLI

To start the Gemini CLI, use the following command:

```bash
gemini
```

## Usage

Interact with your custom tools using natural language.

## Additional Extensions

## Troubleshooting

* "✖ Error during discovery for server: MCP error -32000: Connection closed": The database connection has not been established. Ensure your configuration is set via environment variables.
* "✖ MCP ERROR: Error: spawn /Users/<USER>/.gemini/extensions/cloud-sql-sqlserver/toolbox ENOENT": The Toolbox binary did not download correctly. Ensure you are using Gemini CLI v0.6.0+.
* "cannot execute binary file": The Toolbox binary did not download correctly. Ensure the correct binary for your OS/Architecture has been downloaded. See [Installing the server](https://googleapis.github.io/genai-toolbox/getting-started/introduction/#installing-the-server) for more information.
